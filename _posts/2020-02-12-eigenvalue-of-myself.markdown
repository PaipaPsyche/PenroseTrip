## Discussion
The **success** in facing the daily dilemmas and the occasional unexpected catastrophes that **chance** places in our path depends on our ability to focus our **superior intellect** on the study of our **own being**. Embracing many points of view of the self is a masterful tool for **forging** any new link with the world. The understanding of being is a practice that the 21st century has put aside despite being in these moments of **cultural mishmash** when we most need to look within ourselves.

**Anyone who remains with a single perspective of the world is condemned to wander it on one only path.**
## Technique
Manual filter of facial transformation as the main template. The other layers are made up of patterns **added by collage** and Deep Dream patterns added by contrast. The final image was processed **multiple times** by low-enhancing convolutional filters.
## From the artist
This can be said to be my version of a *"self-portrait"*. A purely subjective representation of what I observed when analyzing my position in the world. I like to represent myself with multiple eyes because I associate them with **knowledge** and **the occult**. For the latter's purposes, I also often include in many of my pieces patterns with sacred geometry and ancestral symbology, as well as **semasiological links** between the myths of tarot, religion and divine science.

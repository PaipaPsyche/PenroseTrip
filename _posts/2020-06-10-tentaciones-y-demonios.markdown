## Discussion
The representation of the devil in the Tarot is usually linked to **creativity, desire and carnality**. Lust and temptation are but facets of an irascible driving force that lies in the **human will**. Free will is the opportunity that randomness gives us to interact with the cosmos in the way that our desire dictates.
## Technique
Contrast superposition of more than 20 layers of **convolutional neural network designs** and recognized paintings in the infernal field of art.
The convolution of most of the layers was done with Deep Dream, a smaller portion was treated with Style Transfer and the other layers were only processed by color shades. The main layer is a photo without prior treatment, so the original features of this can still be differentiated.
## From the artist
The model in the picture is a friend of mine whom I have always admired for promoting the culture of temptation. I am referring to the ambit of **reflecting sensuality** through the mirror and attracting curious glances without involving direct interest. Just as I mentioned before, my intention with the piece is to reflect the **mischief of carnality** as a side effect of an amazingly **complex mind**.
I would never consider myself as a model that inspires eroticism, but this does not make me alien to this one. The representation of desire is also an art and although I do not get very close to the conventional representation of lust, the relationship with the figure of the beast is only a mental bridge with the Tarot myth that I wanted to introduce.

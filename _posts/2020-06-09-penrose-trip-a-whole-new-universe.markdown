**Penrose Trip** is a non-profit site whose purpose is to leave *interesting questions* loose on the streets of the modern world with the only hope of generating even more doubts. The aim is to touch sensitive fibers regarding the compartmentalization of human thought, since the definition of the line between art and science is challenged. Of course, the strong **psychedelic component** of this project cannot be ignored, and it is in this context of perpetual hallucination that the aesthetics of artificial intelligence and randomness make sense; in a world **out of focus**.



## Goodbye, old Penrose
This project has been carried out only by me since the creation of the page in the free hosting services of Github in 2018. The page's first approach was as an image gallery, but with the time it became a gallery of my work and, therefore, an interactive portfolio. It had been carried out with simple HTML pages, with poor Javascript and CSS, and to be honest it was not so pretty aesthetically. This was acceptable as long as it was a portal for personal use, but now that it is more open to the public and even serving as a teaching tool for some Hackathon events, it can only mean one thing:

<b style="font-size:19px"> It is time to migrate to a whole new universe </b>
</div>



## How to migrate?

well, using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll.</a>


> Jekyll is a static site generator. You give it text written in your favorite markup language and it uses layouts to create a static website. You can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed on the site, and more.

*-Jekyll Website*.

Jekyll allows a simple implementation for static pages that allows to segregate posts (like this one) by themes, tags, etc. It is a simple and efficient way to migrate **Penrose Trip** with enough requirements for online execution and storage.


## The future

It's been almost 3 weeks since the migration started and I'm still getting warm. Much of this time has been me learning jekyll from scratch, and although it is an easy-to-learn site generator, it is difficult to diagram the two-year work again and apply the updates and fixes that have been suggested to me. In the future I hope to have all my work here exposed as well as options so that third parties can leave their contributions to this growing personal project.

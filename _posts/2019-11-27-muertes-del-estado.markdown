## Discussion

In recent days, one of the most recent cases of abuse of power in Colombia has come to light. A student named Dylan Cruz is killed by a police riot agent under the excuse that Dylan was involved in violent protests when everything indicates that he did not.

This tragedy gave way to new protests against the Colombian state, which, led by the political party *Centro DemocrÃ¡tico*, ignores all requests. Colombia is submerged in corruption at the hands of political parties that blatantly seek private interests at the expense of the Colombian worker.

## From the artist

The murder of innocent civilians is only more despicable when the government and its institutions try to attribute it to lies and fallacies. A government that allows atrocities like those of Dylan Cruz and the unjustified aggression against peaceful protesters is a government that **deserves to feel the fire of the rebellion**.

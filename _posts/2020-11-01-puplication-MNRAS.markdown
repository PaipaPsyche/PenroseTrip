## Co-autor of a publication!
**Finally!** the work of my undergraduate thesis contributed to the study of the formation of **superclusters in cosmological simulations**. In recent days my thesis advisor together with another undergraduate student wrote a paper where they consolidate the work of some students, including me, in the study of galactic superclusters and their formation in contemporary cosmological simulations (large simulations of structure formation in the universe ) that take into account the cosmology in which we believe our universe unfolds: The **lambda-CDM cosmology**.

## Discussion

Physics, philosophy, mathematics, psychology, biology. Perhaps they are all faces from the same center where everything starts, the **eternal motor** that gives rise to a whole. It is possible that nature itself has a womb from where everything is born and that we can hardly imagine from our human experience.

**What if** there is a superior being that supervises human progress from the shadows? regardless of whether it is a god, an alien, or a being of another nature. Isn't the idea of being watched by something hidden and ominous a little **disturbing**? The idea of Oculus Gea is to represent the watchful *eye of nature* in its maximum expression: as guardian, as judge, as **mother** and as center. The engine of all human and subsequent reasoning is due to the selfless supervision of nature's **perpetual engine**. A reminder that we are as much a part of her as possible and furthermore, that we are not essential to its perpetual clockwork.


## Technique

High Resolution NN Layer plus 3 additional morphed and colored layers .

## From the artist
I think the feeling of being watched is something inherent in human nature. perhaps that explains on some level the **divine experience** that many claim to have or even that strange feeling of being watched( [scopaesthesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychic_staring_effect) ) when no one is around.

It is possible that the feeling that there is **something greater** is a defect of our evolving primate brains, but there is also the possibility that it's something so instinctive that is impossible to explain its origin with the randomness of genetics, that it is a feeling so **rooted** in our nature that it may mean something important.

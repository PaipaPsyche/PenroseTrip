## Discussion
Cities are the urban jewels of our industrialized civilization. It is very likely that whoever is reading this is in a city, but it is only a statistical consequence of their high population density.

The **chronometric cycles** that a city follows in the course of a day are interesting. During the day humans move from the suburbs and residential neighborhoods to the industrial and economic center of the city, and at night they all return to their homes to start the next day: A constant **oscillation** from diastole to systole in each of the daily processes of an average city. The city can be seen then as a great organism that breathes to the **rhythm** of its organic subsystems, and whose sole purpose is to **maintain** itself and **optimize** production.

## Technique

Photo editing

## From the artist
The photo was taken by me from my old workplace, it is the night panorama of downtown Sao Paulo. I found it interesting that when reflecting on the vertical axis the rotated photo, it seems that the **face of a bull** was formed.

It reminded me of how much I always felt trapped in my work, like an ocean of colors locked in a cardboard box.

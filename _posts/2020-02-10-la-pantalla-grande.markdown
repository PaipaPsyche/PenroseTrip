## Discussion
When transcending the world involves **capturing an image** of it and reinterpreting it before the masses, man must turn to art. The performing arts are essentially the way we have found to transport the **great stories** of the world over time and space, making use of our communicative faculties as *homo sapiens sapiens*.


## Technique
Multiple style transfer layers and Deep Dream layers applied to the **same template** and overlapping them with different contrasts and opacities.

## From the artist
The model in the picture is an old friend who chose to study film and television production. Although we don't talk to each other very much, we get along very well and whenever we can meet we talk about infinity of topics without any discomfort. He pointed out to me that, as humans, our only real way of **transcending** is in the image that others have of us.

**Telling stories** with movies and capturing an **emotional footprint** in people have as a common factor that they can preserve a memory for much longer than the time of an average life. The world is a mix of **unexpected events** in real time and **projections** of past memories that we refuse to let die.

I"Ï<p>Welcome traveler! If you have arrived here it is because you are either part of activity B[ORDERS] or you just came across this post out of curiosity. In either case, feel welcome to participate and explore the content of the workshop. <strong>Fuzzy Binaires</strong> is seeking collaboration and community through their own shared practices of open coding, tinkering and making art.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>B[ORDERS]* is an online interdisciplinary workshop program running from July 26 to August 2 2020 in which an interdisciplinary group will question the relations between <strong>technology, orders and borders</strong>. What can be learned from taking positions that refuse the logic of physical and digital borders?</p>

<h2 id="the-border">The Border</h2>

<p>For centuries, the blurred border between the living and the non-living has haunted every corner of the colorful and growing edifice of human knowledge. Since ancient times there have been stories in different religions of how <strong>life arises out of nothing</strong> by divine will and, in some cases, life itself is forged with inert materials. Today we know that inert materials, such as minerals and molecules, constitute life itself, and that the most specific phenomena depend on their <strong>different configurations</strong>. This may have been imagined long before the invention of the microscope, but even now it <strong>is difficult to paint a border</strong> where the inert becomes life.</p>

<p>But it wasnâ€™t until a few decades ago that we began to understand how <strong>complex</strong> the microverse and its rules can be. In the 20th century it was discovered that atoms are not perfect clocks as previously believed, but that they are clouds of probability and that, by construction, they build the <strong>strong link</strong> that exists between the origin of life and the randomness of the quantum world. A completely ordered system cannot give life to life, just as a completely chaotic system cannot maintain it. Creating chaos is simple, but keeping chaos organized and focused is not that easy. I donâ€™t know the definition of life, but many of us can agree that it shares the characteristics of an <strong>unstable, growing and emerging system</strong> that combines the diversity of chaos with the coherence of self-organization, leading to <strong>aggregate phoenomena</strong> that increase in complexity.</p>

<p>With the workshop I want to make you question what is your definition of this limit, if it exists, and how computing can open our minds to more deterministic perspectives that can also lead to chaos. I want to contrast the phenomena that can be seen in nature with the behaviors observed in the evolution of simple simulations.</p>

<h2 id="observing-complexity">Observing complexity</h2>

<p>In the following case studies, we will approach two recognized algorithms in computing, analyzing them from the perspective of emerging behaviors and experimenting with the infinite possibilities they offer. The exercise is precisely to explore the endless analogies that can be built between the natural world and emerging behaviors, that is why in parts of the talk these systems will be discussed as simple algorithms, and sometimes as if they were an organism or living tissue. We are going to let the imagination fly a bit and let the patterns become visible through our perception.</p>

<h2 id="study-cases">Study cases</h2>
<p>The objective of each case study and how it fits the purpose of the activity will be discussed below, however, the most specific content of each sketch is available on the description site of each one (proportional links).</p>
<h3 id="flocking-ecosystem">Flocking ecosystem</h3>
<p>The first algorithm that we are going to analyze is the flocking algorithm. This is characterized by resembling how birds and fish group together in their movement through a limited space populated by many individuals. Although it is an algorithm that has been known for a long time, it is possible to make infinite modifications that undoubtedly make the simulation more interesting, such as the modifications I introduced to do this study. I added agents that create another level of interaction between individuals and lead to the appearance of behaviors analogous to those visible in ecosystems.</p>

<p>Physics, philosophy, mathematics, psychology, biology. Perhaps they are all faces from the same center where everything starts, the <strong>eternal motor</strong> that gives rise to a whole. It is possible that nature itself has a womb from where everything is born and that we can hardly imagine from our human experience.</p>

<p><strong>What if</strong> there is a superior being that supervises human progress from the shadows? regardless of whether it is a god, an alien, or a being of another nature. Isnâ€™t the idea of being watched by something hidden and ominous a little <strong>disturbing</strong>?</p>

<p>I think the feeling of being watched is something inherent in human nature. perhaps that explains on some level the <strong>divine experience</strong> that many claim to have or even that strange feeling of being watched( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychic_staring_effect">scopaesthesia</a> ) when no one is around.</p>

<p>It is possible that the feeling that there is <strong>something greater</strong> is a defect of our evolving primate brains, but there is also the possibility that itâ€™s something so instinctive that is impossible to explain its origin with the randomness of genetics, that it is a feeling so <strong>rooted</strong> in our nature that it may mean something important.</p>

  <p>Scattering, in physics, is a change in the <em>direction of motion</em> of a particle because of a <strong>collision</strong> with another particle.[…] In probing the interior of the atom, the physicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Rutherford"><strong>Ernest Rutherford</strong></a> passed a stream of alpha particles through a thin sheet of gold foil. The alpha particles were emitted by a radioactive material and had enough energy to penetrate an atom; although most passed right through the gold foil, some were <em>deflected</em> in a way that indicated that the scattering was produced by a <strong>Coulomb force</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="the-purpose">The Purpose</h2>
<p>Once the behavior of particles that obey Coulomb’s laws in 2D had been simulated, the next step was to formulate an <strong>experiment</strong> that would allow us to see the benefits of said simulation. Particle scattering is a great example to study as it allows us to visualize how <em>small changes</em> in the charges or positions of the particles on the bombarded surface affect the direction of the <em>incident particle beam</em>.</p>

<h2 id="the-controls">The Controls</h2>
<p>The particle beam enters the screen from the left side. Then it comes across 3 barriers of <em>“ions”</em>, each with a different charge than the previous layer, and then an <em>object</em> with ions of arbitrary charge.</p>

<p>CLICK on an atom to <em>flip</em> its charge. CLICK on an empty space to create a dust particle (same kind of particle present in the incident beam) with velocity to the left.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>P (while hovering an ion):</strong> liberates the ion from its fixed position.</li>
  <li><strong>F :</strong> flips the charge of a random ion.</li>
  <li><strong>W :</strong> Moves the origin of the beam UP.</li>
  <li><strong>S :</strong> Moves the origin of the beam DOWN.</li>
</ul>

<p>The representation of the devil in the Tarot is usually linked to <strong>creativity, desire and carnality</strong>. Lust and temptation are but facets of an irascible driving force that lies in the <strong>human will</strong>. Free will is the opportunity that randomness gives us to interact with the cosmos in the way that our desire dictates.</p>

<p>Contrast superposition of more than 20 layers of <strong>convolutional neural network designs</strong> and recognized paintings in the infernal field of art.
The convolution of most of the layers was done with Deep Dream, a smaller portion was treated with Style Transfer and the other layers were only processed by color shades. The main layer is a photo without prior treatment, so the original features of this can still be differentiated.</p>

<p>The model in the picture is a friend of mine whom I have always admired for promoting the culture of temptation. I am referring to the ambit of <strong>reflecting sensuality</strong> through the mirror and attracting curious glances without involving direct interest. Just as I mentioned before, my intention with the piece is to reflect the <strong>mischief of carnality</strong> as a side effect of an amazingly <strong>complex mind</strong>.
I would never consider myself as a model that inspires eroticism, but this does not make me alien to this one. The representation of desire is also an art and although I do not get very close to the conventional representation of lust, the relationship with the figure of the beast is only a mental bridge with the Tarot myth that I wanted to introduce.</p>

<p>Today, most of the worldâ€™s social interactions occur thanks to <strong>massive information networks</strong> that allow users to capture their identity on their virtual profile and expose themselves to the eyes of the world. While this often helps the masses <strong>keep up</strong> with a world that is advancing by leaps and bounds, this lends itself to many unwanted scenarios of deception and false self-esteem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sometimes we forget about how important is to be more interesting in real life than whoever you are on the internet.</p>

<p>When creating a <strong>persona</strong> in social networks, we rarely stop to think how much we want this new social network to infiltrate our lives. We do not know how much we are willing to <strong>share authentically</strong> and when we least think about it we are showing our Sunday breakfast to 600 strangers.</p>

<p>With this work I wanted to reflect our <strong>innocence and ingenuity</strong> when facing a tool as powerful on so many levels of our society as the internet is. We are barely intelligent apes that managed to create a <strong>network of shared knowledge</strong>, and now that we have managed to expand it to all the recesses of our daily life, we tenderly have the <strong>illusion</strong> of knowing what we are doing and where we are going.</p>

<p>As a sentient human being and observer of my environment, it is easy for me to notice that, as humankind, we are atrophying. When watching a sunset we prefer to take out the phone and see it through the screen, instead of simply marveling at the sublime vision that is presented to us. Sometimes we make a bigger effort to make a good post on social media than to support a loved one through a crisis. We create fake news to manipulate the masses, when the only effect they have is to confuse and illiterate.</p>

  <p><strong>We choose to ignore how ignorant they have made us.</strong></p>

<p>The image shows the explorer crossing the threshold of the unknown that, ironically, is also full of gazes. A swirling and diffuse vision of a <strong>multicolored cosmos of possibilities</strong> that can amaze anyone with a pair of eyes. The innocence of Ikaro flying closer and closer to the sun, not knowing that his ignorance of the situation would cost him everything.</p>

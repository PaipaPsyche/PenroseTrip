<p>With more experience with genetic algorithms, I decided to experiment with one that involved continuous and more complex behaviors. In my other genetic learning sketches, the genetic algorithm always boils down to a set of discrete values as a possible gene expression, but in this case a much broader spectrum of values and possible alterations is being taken. They are independent cells that react to three external agents: waste, food and other cells. The cells roam in a free space and their genetic expression regulates everything within, from nutrition to movement.</p>

<h2 id="the-purpose">The Purpose</h2>

<h2 id="the-result">The Result</h2>
<p>The genetic monitor allows to graph the genetic expression of the cell in such a way that it is easy to determine the origin of its affinity to certain behaviors. The cell monitor allows you to track all the vital signs and content of the cell it represents. Both are ways to visualize confusing data in a more attractive and intuitive way.</p>

<p>Each Genetic code has a unique number to identify itself. Each  code has two parents, each with an <strong>ID number</strong> as well.</p>

<h3 id="genetic-slot-monitor">Genetic Slot Monitor</h3>
<p>It is the representation of the genetic code of each cell. In this you can see the following details that provide information (left box of the image):</p>
<h4 id="numbers">Numbers</h4>
<ul>
  <li>In the lower left corner there is the generation of the given genome.</li>
  <li>in the bottom,centered, the name of the genetic id code in format “DAD-ME-MOM”.</li>
  <li>When selected in the genetic Slot Monitor, the boxes have the slot number in the top left corner.
    <h4 id="top--axis">Top  axis</h4>
    <p>This is the <strong>affinity</strong> axis, where a line extending to the left means a negative value and a line to the right means positive affinity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The Green gene represents <strong>cell affinity</strong>, meaning the <em>attraction</em> to other cells. the extra line segment represent a bias in the mass subtraction in order to react to the other cell’s size.</li>
  <li>The Blue gene is <strong>food affinity</strong>, meaning attraction to food particles.</li>
  <li>The Red gene is <strong>waste affinity</strong>, meaning attraction to waste particles.
    <h4 id="bottom--axis">Bottom  axis</h4>
    <p>This is the <strong>deterministic</strong> axis, where a line extending to the left means a deterministic cell behavior and a line to the right means random movement approach.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The top olive gene is the <strong>speed persistence</strong>, which each cycle determines whether being conservative and keeping the same direction (Right) or changing the movement direction according to other internal and external responses (Left)</li>
  <li>The bottom purple gene is the <strong>arbitrary movement</strong>, which each cycle determines whether taking  a step in a random direction (Right) or to obey to other internal and external responses (Left)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-controls">The Controls</h2>
<p>The buttons and sliders of the application allow you to interact with the simulation parameters.</p>

<p><strong>SLIDERS:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Viscosity</strong> defines the resistance the medium has to the movement of cells.</li>
  <li><strong>Initial Food</strong> sets the number of food particles present in the beginning of each generation.</li>
  <li><strong>Minimum food</strong> is the minimum number of food particles that the simulation has. If there are less food particles, the simulation will append new ones to the medium.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>BUTTONS:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Nex Generation</strong> polls the population score and resets the map, generating a new genetic pool with the previous generation data.</li>
  <li><strong>Remove Items</strong> removes all food and waste particles.</li>
  <li><strong>Clear monitors</strong> blanks all the genetic slots.</li>
  <li><strong>Toggle vectors</strong> switches ON/OFF to display all the cell vectors.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>SELECTORS:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Main Goal</strong> defines the scoring method for the cells.</li>
  <li><strong>CELL INIDICATORS</strong> set the 4 values that each cell has displayed in the upper and lower margins.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>KEYBOARD &amp; MOUSE:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>CLICK :</strong> operates buttons,selectors and sliders. click on a cell to display its genetic code and its vital signs. click on empty space to create a new cell.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>1 / 2 / 3 / 4 (While hovering a cell):</strong> displays the cell´s genetic code in genetic slot (1,2,3, or 4) .</li>
  <li><strong>N :</strong> Next generation.</li>
  <li><strong>C :</strong> Creates a new cell in the cursor XY position</li>
  <li><strong>F :</strong> Creates a food particle in the cursor XY position.</li>
  <li><strong>W :</strong> Creates a Waste particle in the cursor XY position.</li>
  <li><strong>X (While hovering a cell):</strong> Explodes the cell.</li>
</ul>
